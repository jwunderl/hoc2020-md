# Teach Farming

## Step 1
The villagers agreed to teach the illagers how to farm, but first they need farmland setup. Have the Agent replace the gravel pad with farmland.

#### ~ tutorialhint 
Use the ``||hoc2020:prepare soil||`` block to move forward while replacing the gravel with tilled soil.

```ghost
    hoc2020.tillSoil(1)
    hoc2020.turnAgent()  
```
```template
\\
```
```package
hoc2020-ts=github:neonerz/hoc2020-ts
```
